# android-tree-sitter

<a href="https://github.com/itsaky/AndroidIDE"><img src="https://androidide.com/github/img/androidide.php?part&for-the-badge"/></a><br><br>
Android Java bindings for [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/). Currently used
in [AndroidIDE](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE)
and [sora-editor](https://github.com/Rosemoe/sora-editor).

## Add to your project

![Latest maven release](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.itsaky.androidide.treesitter/android-tree-sitter)

```gradle
// main library
implementation 'com.itsaky.androidide.treesitter:android-tree-sitter:<version>'

// grammar libraries
// <language> is the name of the language grammar. e.g. 'java', 'python', 'xml', etc.
implementation 'com.itsaky.androidide.treesitter:tree-sitter-<language>:<version>'
```

Before using tree sitter, load the native library when appropriate (e.g. in the `onCreate()` method of your `Application` class, or in your activity) :

```java
TreeSitter.loadLibrary();
```

The following grammars have been published to Maven central :

- Java
- JSON
- Kotlin
- Logs (for highlighting logs in AndroidIDE)
- Python
- XML

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Android NDK
- `JDK 11` or newer.
    - `JAVA_HOME` must be set to a JDK installation containing header files in
      the `JAVA_HOME/include` directory. The JDK bundled with Android Studio does not contain these
      headers.
- `build-essential`, `nodejs`, `cmake` and `ninja-build` packages are required for builds.
  Install them with :
  ```
  sudo apt install build-essential nodejs cmake ninja-build
  ```

- You'll also need to install `rust` and `cargo` (>= v1.74.0). Follow the
  instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) to get started with the
  installation.

- [`tree-sitter-cli`](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/tree/master/cli) - To build
  grammars.

As tree-sitter is already included in the source (as a submodule), the `tree-sitter-cli` is built
from source and then used to build the grammars.

Read [the documentation](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/tree/master/cli) on how to
install pre-built versions of `tree-sitter`.

If you want to use a prebuilt `tree-sitter` binary (either manually installed or installed
with `npm` or `cargo`), make sure it is accessible in the `PATH`, then set
the `TS_CLI_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE` environment variable :

```bash
export TS_CLI_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=false
```

> _IMPORTANT: Building on a Linux machine is recommended._

### Get source

Clone this repo with :

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/android-tree-sitter
```

### Install grammar dependencies

You might need to install the Node packages required by the grammars. For example, the `cpp` grammar
requires you to install the packages:

```bash
# from the root directory of this project
cd grammars/cpp && npm install && cd -
```

### Build

A normal Gradle build (`./gradlew build`) can be executed in order to build everything for Android
_and_ the host OS. To build `android-tree-sitter` and the grammars _only_ for the host OS, you can
execute `buildForHost` task on appropriate subprojects.

## Adding grammars

The Gradle modules for the grammars are almost identical, with only minor differences in the
CMakeLists file and the Java binding class.

These Gradle modules are automatically generated by
the [`DynamicModulePlugin`](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/android-tree-sitter/tree/dev/build-logic/ats/src/main/java/com/itsaky/androidide/treesitter/DynamicModulePlugin.kt).
The generation process relies on
the [`grammars.json`](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/android-tree-sitter/tree/dev/grammars/grammars.json)
file. More information about the structure of this JSON file can be found in
the [README](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/android-tree-sitter/blob/dev/grammars/README.md)
under the `grammars` directory.

Apart from the `DynamicModulePlugin`, there
are [other Gradle plugins](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/android-tree-sitter/tree/dev/build-logic/ats/src/main/java/com/itsaky/androidide/treesitter)
which are used to configure and build the grammars effectively.

The common configuration for the grammars can be found in
the [`build.gradle.kts`](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/android-tree-sitter/blob/52cc0400feee5079cac25b27d1e7b673ee53f436/build.gradle.kts#L136)
file. This is where you can make changes or adjustments to the module configuration that applies to
all grammars.

The generated modules are located in the `rootDir/grammar-modules` directory. This is where you can
find the output of the module generation process.

To add a new grammar to the project, follow these steps:

1. Begin by adding the grammar source code to the `grammars` directory. To accomplish this, you can
   add a submodule using the following command:

    ```bash
    git submodule add <remote_url> grammars/<language_name>
    ```

2. The `language_name` should be the simple name of the language, without the `tree-sitter-` prefix.
   This name is used to generate both the shared library and the Gradle module. For example, if
   the `language_name` is `abc`:
    - The module `tree-sitter-abc` will be automatically generated.
    - The name of the resulting shared library will be `libtree-sitter-abc.so`.
3. After adding the grammar source, update the `grammars.json` file to include the newly added
   grammar in the project.
4. Finally, sync the project to trigger the generation of the module for the newly added grammar.

## Loading external grammars

You have two ways to load grammars that are not published along with this project :

- Package the grammar with your application.
- Load the grammar at runtime using `TSLanguage.loadLanguage`.

`TSLanguage.loadLanguage` uses `dlopen` to load the library and must be CAREFULLY used. Also,
grammars that are loaded using this method must be closed when they are not used.

> **_Prefer using the first method whenever possible._**

### Package the grammar with your application

You can package the grammar in your Android application as you would package any other shared
library :

- Include the `libtree-sitter-myLang.so` file in the `jniLibs` directory of your project.
- Create a native method in a Java class which will return the pointer to the language :

```java
package com.my.app;

public class MyClass {

  static {
    System.loadLibrary("tree-sitter-myLang");
  }

  public static native long myLang();
}
```

- Write the C/C++ implementation for the method :

```c++
extern "C" TSLanguage *tree_sitter_myLang();

extern "C"
JNIEXPORT jlong JNICALL
Java_com_my_app_MyClass_myLang(JNIEnv *env, jclass clazz) {
  // simply cast the language pointer to jlong
  return (jlong) tree_sitter_myLang();
}
```

- Create and use the `TSLanguage` instance :

```java
final TSLanguage myLang=TSLanguage.create("myLang",MyClass.myLang());

// use it with TSParser
  try(final var parser=TSParser.create()){
  parser.setLanguage(myLang);
  ...
  }
```

### Load grammars at runtime

> android-tree-sitter `v3.1.0` or newer is required for this method.

`TSLanguage` provides `loadLanguage(String, String)` method which can be used to load the grammars
at runtime. This method uses `dlopen` to load the shared library, get the language instance and
return its pointer. Use this method CAREFULLY.

The language instances created using this method **MUST** be closed using `TSLanguage.close()`.
Calling the `close` method ensures that the underlying `dlopen`'ed library handle is closed
using `dlclose`.

Usage :

```java
// provide the path to the shared library and the name of the language
// the name is used to cache the language instance
// further invocations of this method with the same lang name returns the
// cached language instance
final TSLanguage myLang=TSLanguage.loadLanguage("/path/to/libtree-sitter-myLang.so","myLang");

  if(myLang!=null){
  // loaded successfully
  }else{
  // failed to load the language
  // see logcat for details
  }
```

Use this language :

```java
try(final var parser=TSParser.create()){
  parser.setLanguage(myLang);
  ...
  }
```

You don't have to keep a reference to `myLang`. Once loaded, the language can be accessed
using `TSLanguageCache` :

```java
// returns the 'myLang' instance i.e. both are same
final TSLanguage cachedMyLang=TSLanguageCache.get("myLang");
```

**DO NOT FORGET** to close the language :

```java
// this closes the underlying library handle
myLang.close();
```
